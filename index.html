									<h2><a href="#">Who I Am & What I Do</a></h2>
									<p>
										Hi there! I’m a recent graduate in Mathematics from Hacettepe University with a strong passion for data science, analytics, and problem-solving. Over the past few years, I’ve been on a journey to turn my love for numbers into meaningful insights.
									</p>
							
									<p>
										During my studies, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the Erasmus+ program at Politechnika Częstochowska in Poland. Spending a semester abroad not only improved my communication and adaptability skills but also helped me grow personally by stepping out of my comfort zone, embracing new cultures, and building lifelong connections.
									</p>
							
									<p>
										I also completed a 9 months internship at <strong>Trive</strong> in the Data Analytics team, where I worked on real-world data problems. I was responsible for collecting, cleaning, and analyzing large-scale datasets, developing reports, and creating visual dashboards to support business decisions. I contributed to building new data sources and took part in data modeling processes using tools like <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib), and <strong>Tableau</strong>. This hands-on experience helped me understand how data really flows in a business environment.
									</p>
							
									<p>
										To deepen my technical foundation, I joined two major bootcamps organized by Akbank, focusing on both <strong>Data Analysis</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong>. In the analysis bootcamp, I worked on an IMDb Movie Dataset project where I applied data cleaning techniques and created insightful visualizations. In the machine learning bootcamp, I developed a <strong>Library Management System</strong> — a Python CLI app built with object-oriented programming — that allowed users to manage book records and simulate borrowing logic.
									</p>
							
									<p>
										I’m also actively investing in my learning. I’ve completed the <strong>CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python</strong> course and am currently working through <strong>CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python</strong> to explore areas like search algorithms, adversarial games, and machine learning fundamentals. One of my latest projects is a Boston Housing regression model, where I applied linear regression using gradient descent to predict housing prices based on key features.
									</p>
							
									<p>
										I would describe myself as a curious, detail-oriented, and growth-driven person. I love diving into data, spotting patterns, and building things that make processes smarter. Outside of work, I enjoy yoga and self-development, and I’m currently working on mastering advanced flexibility and strength moves (splits and handstands are on the list!).
									</p>
							
									<p>
										My long-term goal is to become a valuable part of a data team where I can contribute to solving meaningful problems and continue learning every day. I’m excited about the possibilities that lie ahead, and I’m always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and conversations.
